## Introduction

Our dataset is based on GossipCop, which is proposed by FakeNewsNet([ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01286))([Github](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet))

We did some preprocessing:

| version |     feature      | legitimate | fake | total |
|:-------:|:----------------:|:----------:|:----:|:-----:|
|   v1    |  having "text"   |   14991    | 4717 | 19708 |
|   v2    |  having "title"  |   14928    | 4706 | 19634 |
|   v3    | in proper length |   11945    | 3784 | 15729 |

We use v3 to do further processing.

We designed 6 ways to generate news.

- [Style-based Fake](#style-based-fake)
- [Content-based Fake](#content-based-fake)
- [Integration-based Fake](#integration-based-fake)
- [Story-based Fake](#story-based-fake)
- [Style-based Legitimate](#style-based-legitimate)
- [Integration-based Legitimate](#integration-based-legitimate)

Except for task "Content-based Fake", which uses [GLM4](https://www.chatglm.cn/) for generation, all other tasks use [ChatGLM3](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3).

The statistics for each task:

| Task Name                    | Total  |
| ---------------------------- |:------:|
| Style-based Fake             | 15729  |

| Integration-based Fake       |  2697  |
| Story-based Fake             | 15729  |

Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films.\n\n鈥淲e made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I鈥檓 going to love singing,鈥? said Salonga, 鈥渁nd because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.鈥漒n\nSalonga is keeping the program鈥檚 song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut.\n\n鈥淭his will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.鈥漒n\nA regular feature of Salonga鈥檚 solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet 鈥淎 Whole New World鈥? from 鈥淎laddin.鈥漒n\n鈥淣o need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn鈥檛 have to have it memorized fully,鈥? she said. 鈥淚 want them to have fun.鈥漒n\nSalonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 鈥淟es Mis茅rables鈥?

Tonya Harding says the Olympics have changed since she competed all those years ago.  \"Wow, I'm so glad I'm not competing against them now,\" Harding says of the Olympic figure skaters, noting that the \"point system\" has changed. \"I was all about doing the triple axel or the triple-triple, and now you can do the triple-triple and still get the same points that you would for the triple axel. So, why do the triple axel?\"  Harding was the first American woman to successfully do a triple axel in a competition, and recalls the moment she knew she landed the move. \"I was like, 'Yes! I did this!'\" she says. \"I competed for me but I performed for the people.\"  Harding also remembers being at the Olympics and thinking, \"Holy crap.\"  \"Then you have to remember to bring yourself back down to a level that this is just another competition,\" she explains. \"You're like that for a bit and then you start to look around and you're like, 'Holy crap, this is the Olympics.'\"  Harding has found herself back in the limelight this year after the success of the movie I, Tonya, which is about her life as a figure skater. She tells DeGeneres that she's quite happy with how the film turned out.  \"I achieved something in my life that meant something,\" she says. \"With the new movie, it actually made my life feel like it was worth something.\"  In January, Harding joined the I, Tonya cast at the Golden Globes and celebrated with Allison Janney after she won for her portrayal of LaVona Golden, Harding's mother.  \"She was overwhelmed by the movie,\" Janney told ET's Kevin Frazier of Harding's reaction to the critically acclaimed film. \"I think she's having a great moment. I think she loves it and I think she should because the movie tells a more nuanced side of her story.\"  Janney added, \"It's much more complicated then what we first thought when this incident happened back in the '90s.\"  Check out more of our exclusive interview with the Golden Globe winner:",
